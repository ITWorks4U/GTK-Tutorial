# GTK

Here you can find some programming samples of the GTK+ programming in C only. These programming requires well known knowledge of the C/C++ programming, too.
You can find the tutorials on my channel, too, which are in German, however, the programming itself contains the English written implementation.

### How to use GTK?
If not already done, then these steps are mandatory to work with GTK programming in C:
- make sure, you're well known in C/C++ programming and you can handle with the GTK wiki ;-)
- these programming examples are running under a Linux system; it's not tested, if these will run on an another system, too

### programs
- Glade 3.22.1 (can be installed from the software center)
- any editor
- the current gcc/g++ compiler

### libraries
libgtk-3-dev --> sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev

Finally, if you've questions, wishes or else, then contact me.

Have fun!
